	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>Some years ago I wrote a blog post, <a href="http://blog.adw.org/2018/05/church-cruise-ship-battleship/">Is the Church a Cruise Ship or a Battleship</a>? I was surprised at the amount of negative commentary I got. For example, &#8220;How dare you compare the Church to an instrument of war!&#8221; Other comments lamented recourse to any violent imagery, ever. Still others called for bans on songs such as &#8220;Onward Christian Soldiers,&#8221; &#8220;I am On the Battlefield for My Lord,&#8221; and so forth. You might say that the response from the anti-military group was &#8220;militant.&#8221; I certainly wasn&#8217;t feelin&#8217; the love! Most of those comments I didn&#8217;t publish because I didn&#8217;t want &#8220;war&#8221; to erupt in the combox.</p>
<p><strong>Of course the reference to a battleship was by way of analogy, not literal.</strong> No one is insisting that the Church should actually use sixteen inch guns against unbelievers or purveyors of sin. The battle is a spiritual one requiring spiritual weapons. This is why we call it spiritual warfare!</p>
<p><strong>It is important in our times that we recover some sophistication when it comes to language and how people use it.</strong> Analogies, similes, metaphors and the like are not to be interpreted in a crudely literalistic way. Deadpan literalism usually shows a lack of sophistication and maturity needed to engage others in a real conversation about what is actually being said. It usually rejects the possibility of analogy or hyperbole and assumes bad will on the part of one&#8217;s interlocutor, looking to take offense when none is intended.</p>
<p><strong>Earlier this year an article in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/08/radical-traditionalist-catholic-christian-rosary-weapon/671122/">The Atlantic</a> made such laments and actually expressed fears of growing violence</strong> that might come from &#8220;traditional&#8221; Catholics with all their talk of &#8220;war,&#8221; and so forth.  The author claimed that the rosary was an example of  &#8220;extremist gun culture&#8221; among traditional (he calls them &#8220;rad-trad&#8221;) Catholics.   Of course the article and the author exhibited just the kind of unsophisticated deadpan literalism mentioned above and thereby exhibited a gravely deficient understanding of an ancient Catholic tradition and instinct that we call spiritual warfare. I wonder if he even talked to an actual traditional Catholic, or was he just looking for trouble? Further, how many mass shooters or violent gang shooters march under Catholic banners? None.</p>
<p><strong>But as noted above, many inside the Church as well misunderstand the battle language of spiritual warfare</strong> and, as a result, are either offended or fearful about the metaphorical language used by the faithful. But this should invite investigation rather than quick rejection.</p>
<p><strong>To all the hand-wringing associated with &#8220;violent imagery&#8221; I can only say, &#8220;Hail Mary, full of grace, punch the devil in the face.&#8221;</strong> In other words I don&#8217;t think apologies and changes are due when some take offense at metaphorical language the Church has used for the whole of her existence. The picture above of Mary punching the devil in the face is from the 13th Century. But the tradition of Mary and Jesus at war with the Devil is even older than that. If the use of violent imagery in the spiritual warfare against Satan and the kingdom of darkness is such a terrible thing, then God Himself never got the memo. God said in Genesis 3:15  <em>And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed. He will crush your head while you will strike his heel</em>. Gadzooks! Such violence!</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-medium wp-image-42986 alignleft" style="font-size: 1rem" src="http://blog.adw.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bullet-Rosary-300x274.png" alt="" width="300" height="274" srcset="http://blog.adw.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bullet-Rosary-300x274.png 300w, http://blog.adw.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bullet-Rosary.png 751w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
<p><strong>In this vein, I have recently attracted some negative attention by</strong> referring in <span style="font-size: 1rem">serm</span><span style="font-size: 1rem">ons and writi</span>ngs of the rosary as a &#8220;fifty-round clip&#8221; to fire at the dev<span style="font-size: 1rem">il. Again, most people &#8220;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem">get it,&#8221; while a small but vocal minority object to such violent imagery. I upped the ante with my recent purchase of a &#8220;bullet rosary&#8221; (see photo at left). Such a image has sparked both whimsical understanding and instant outrage among those who have seen it. One woman protested that, with all the violent shootings and killing in our land, such a rosary is reprehensible. But this weapon, and these bullets are directed against Satan. Real bullets cannot harm Satan since he has no body. But the spiritual bullets of rosary prayers, other prayers, fasting, obedience  and so forth can inflict real harm on the kingdom of darkness. These are the practices  at the heart of spiritual warfare. The message of a &#8220;bullet rosary&#8221; is that unless we are willing to wage spiritual warfare we get physical warfare. Our Lady at Fatima said “Pray the rosary every day to bring peace to the world and the end of the war.” (1st Apparition May 13, 1917) </span></p>
<p><strong>The Rosary is the chief weapon of our times.</strong> To exasperated souls who lament the moral condition of this world comes the answer: &#8220;Pray the Rosary.&#8221; What are you waiting for? Take up your weapon and wage war against Satan. If we will not wage spiritual warfare what we will get is physical warfare: real bullets, tanks, planes bombs and all the death toll.</p>
<p><strong>To those who still fret at the warlike imagery, I can only say, Sorry, but we <em>are</em> at war whether you like it or not.</strong> Satan wages war against the faithful and you&#8217;d better take up your weapons too. This war waged against us by Satan is responsible for most of the casualties you see lying about you: those addicted, those who die from hatred, racism and physical violence, the sexually confused, victims of the sexual revolution, those destroyed by drinking and overeating, those lost in greed, and those lost in confusion so deep they cannot even distinguish a man from a woman.  Yes, we are at war and the victims lie all about us. And if we will not choose sides and do battle, we are not just useless, we are on the other side.</p>
<p><strong>Those who want to &#8220;sit on the fence&#8221; forget that Satan owns the fence.</strong> There are only two armies on the field. <em>Tertium non datur</em> (no third way is given).</p>
<p><strong>Take up your beads, your fifty-round clip and start shooting.</strong> <em>Blessed be the LORD, my Rock, who trains my hands for war, my fingers for battle! </em>(Psalm 144:1) The Church is not a clubhouse, she is a lighthouse meant to conquer the darkness. She is not a cruise ship, she is a battleship sent to despoil Satan by shooting rounds of truth snatching back souls from his lying grasp.</p>
<p>This is war. Fight or be conquered.</p>

		<p>Many wonderful articles have already been published in reference to the death of Pope Emeritus Benedict. I can only affirm much of what I have read as to his scholarship, and the dignity with which he conducted the Office of the Papacy. To have such a renowned theologian as pope makes one think of Pope Gregory the Great who like Pope Benedict would have prefered the quiet of the monastery to the heavy weight of the chair of Peter.</p>
<p><strong>Neither Gregory or Benedict had it easy.</strong> Tumultuous waves rocked the barque of Peter during Gregory&#8217;s time as the Roman Empire continued to crumble and the Lombards made their steady advance. Pope Benedict XVI endured the storms of the collapsing Western culture, lamenting that the lights were going out in Europe and he warned us of the &#8220;dictatorship of relativism&#8221; that we now know all too well.</p>
<p><strong>Surely, if the lights were going out in the dying West, the Church must all the more be as a lighthouse in the deepening dark.</strong> I was certain that Pope Benedict was just the man the Lord could use. But Pope Benedict also sensed the wolves were near, and asked us to pray that he not flee from them. Sadly, as we know, for reasons of his own, he chose to step aside. I cannot doubt that he thought it best for the Church, but I must still lament the loss of his light in a world sinking into deeper darkness and murky confusion. It is zero-dark thirty for the Western world we once called Christendom.  And we, the Church, called to be the light of the world, are terribly divided and caught in a morass of scandal, ambiguity and confusion.</p>
<p><strong>I can only ask God to receive Pope Benedict XIV into the arms of His mercy</strong> and permit his prayers for us to be like a ray of light shining past the barrier of death on a gloomy and storm-tossed world.  Permit my informal cry like a son to his father: &#8220;Papa Ratzi pray for us! And we too prayer for your repose, dear and Holy Father.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Sometimes when you struggle</strong> to cry, humor has a role in releasing sorrow and also pent up joy. In that vein, I&#8217;d like to include a short video I put together many years ago that celebrated the photogenic quality of Pope Benedict. His face is wonderfully expressive. I hope you might enjoy a one minute diversion down memory lane as a moment too of prayer.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">I also put together another video of the Pope as a pilgrim and world traveler set to Johnny Cash&#8217;s &#8220;I&#8217;ve Been Everywhere.&#8221; Enjoy a toe tapper of a song with photos showing the Pope&#8217;s far flung travels.</p>

		<p><span style="color: #000000">The feast day of January 1st is a very complex tapestry, both culturally and liturgically. Perhaps we can use the second reading by St. Paul to the Galatians as a way to weave through some of the many details. We can look at it in three parts.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>I. The chronology of our celebration</strong></span>– The text from St. Paul’s letter to the Galatians says, <em>When the fullness of time had come …</em></span></p>

23e8
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Most people are going about today saying, “Happy New Year!” </strong>And rightfully so, for it <em>is </em>the beginning of a new year; but most people think of New Year’s Day in almost wholly secular terms. Sadly, it is best known as an occasion for loud parties and excessive drinking.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>It is a mistake to view New Year’s Day simply as a secular holiday. </strong>In speaking of “the fullness of time,” St. Paul reminds us that all time and all ages belong to God.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>It is not simply 2023; it is 2023 Anno Domini (A.D.). </strong>Even the most unbelieving of people in the Western world denote their place in time in relation to Jesus Christ. It is 2023 years since the birth of Christ. Every time we write the date on a check or at the top of a letter, every time we see it at the top of the newspaper or on our computer screen, that number, 2023, points back to Christ. He is the Lord of history. Jesus sets the date; He is the clock by which we measure. All time belongs to Him.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Jesus says in the book of Revelation, </strong><em>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, The beginning and the end. He who is, and who was, and who is to come </em>(Rev 22:13).</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>If it is true </strong>that 2023 references the birth of Christ, then why is Christmas Day not also New Year’s Day? The fact that it is not actually makes a lot of sense if we understand liturgical and spiritual sensibilities.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>In the Church and stretching back into ancient Jewish times, it was customary to celebrate the high feasts of faith over the period of a week. </strong>In Christian tradition this came to be known as the “octave.” Although we think of a week as comprising seven days, consider that we celebrated Christmas this past Sunday and now this week we celebrate New Year’s Day on Sunday; Sunday to Sunday, inclusive, is eight days.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Tuesday, January 1, 2023 is the eighth day of Christmas. </strong>In the Christian tradition, the octave is considered as one long “day” that lasts for eight days. Therefore, Tuesday, January 1, 2023 completes Christmas day; it is fulfilled. Or, as St. Paul says, the “fullness of time” in terms of Christmas day has come. At the end of this eight-day Christmas day, our calendar flips from 2022 to 2023 A.D.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>The rest of the secular world has largely moved on already, </strong>barely thinking of Christmas anymore. As I walk in my neighborhood, I see Christmas trees already set out at the curb waiting to be picked up by the recycling trucks. Yes, for many in our hurried world, Christmas is over. We in the Church, however, continue to celebrate the great Christmas feast and cycle. Having completed the octave, we move on to Epiphany week.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>This New Year’s Day we contemplate the “fullness of time.” </strong>The passage of another year reminds us of the magnificent truth that to God all time—past, present, and future—is equally present. He holds all things together in Himself. He is the same yesterday, today, tomorrow, and forever. Whenever He acts, He acts in our time, out of the fullness of time. This is a very deep mystery and we should ponder in silence the mystery that for God, all things <em>are</em>. He is not waiting for things to happen. For Him, everything is accomplished.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>II. The content of our celebration</strong></span><strong> </strong>– St. Paul goes on to say, <em>God sent forth his son born of a woman. </em>This statement again reminds that we are still in the Christmas cycle.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000">While it is New Year’s Day, there is also a complex tapestry of religious meanings to this day as well. It is still Christmas day, the eighth day of the one long day that we call Christmas.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>Historically, this is also the day of Christ’s circumcision</strong><strong>. </strong></span>For a long period in Church history, today was the feast of “The Circumcision of the Lord.” As I have written <a href="http://blog.adw.org/2013/12/on-time-warps-and-missing-feasts-a-critique-of-the-puzzling-cycle-of-christmas-feast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously</a>, I regret the loss of this feast, at least in terms of its title.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="color: #000000">Today is the day when Joseph and Mary brought Christ to be circumcised. In this, Jesus as man and as God reverences the covenant He has made with His people. It is a beautiful truth that God seeks relationship with His people. In this covenantal act of the circumcision is the moving truth that Jesus is not ashamed to call us His brothers (Heb 2:11).</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="color: #000000">There is the first shedding of Jesus’ blood. It is also a sign of His love for us.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>This feast day also celebrates the Most Holy Name of Jesus</strong></span><strong>, </strong>for not only was a Jewish boy circumcised on the eighth day, but he was also given his name; all heard that name for the first time on that day.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="color: #000000">The name Jesus means “God saves.” Indeed, this Most Holy Name of Jesus, when used in reverence, has saving power. We are baptized in His Holy Name along with that of the Father and the Holy Spirit, and all of our prayers conclude with His Holy Name. Scripture says this of His great and holy name:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px"><span style="color: #000000"><em>Therefore, God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue acknowledge that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father</em> (Phil 2: 9-11).</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>Yet another meaning of today’s feast day is shown in its current, formal title: “The Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God.” </strong></span>This replaced the title of “The Feast of the Circumcision of the Lord” in 1970. However, it <em>is </em>the most ancient title for this feast day. Again, you may read more on this topic in <a href="http://blog.adw.org/on-time-warps-and-missing-feasts-a-critique-of-the-puzzling-cycle-of-christmas-feast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a previous blog post</a>.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="color: #000000">We note in the second reading that St. Paul says that <em>God sent forth his Son, born of a woman</em>. Jesus is the eternal Son of the Father; He is God from God, Light from Light, True God from True God. Jesus is God, and because Mary gave birth to Him, she is the Mother of God because Jesus is not two different persons.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="color: #000000">Mary did not just give birth to part of Jesus, she gave birth to Jesus. Thus, the title “Mother of God” speaks to us as much about Jesus as it does about Mary. She has that title because of the Church’s insistence that Jesus cannot be divided up into two different people. We cannot say that Mary gave birth to one Jesus but not to “the other one.” Although He has two natures, human and divine, there is only one Jesus.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="color: #000000">Thus, on this feast of Christmas, on this eighth day of Christmas, we are reminded and solemnly taught that Jesus is both human and divine. In taking a human nature to Himself from His mother Mary, He remains one person. <em>God has sent forth his son, born of woman.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>III. The consolation of our celebration</strong></span>– St. Paul goes on to say, <em>Born under the law to ransom those under the law so that we might receive adoption as sons. As proof that you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son in our hearts crying out Abba, Father! So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and, if a son, also an heir through God. </em>Note three things about this passage:</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>Our A
4836
doption</strong></span>– We have already noted that on the eighth day Jesus is circumcised and enters into the Covenant, into the Law. In the Incarnation, He joins the human family; in the Covenant, He joins our family of faith. He will fulfill the old Covenant and inaugurate the new one. By this New Covenant, by baptism into Him, we become members of His Body and are thereby adopted as sons.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="color: #000000">We become sons in the Son. When God the Father looks at His Son, loving Him, He is also looking at us and loving us, for we are in Christ Jesus, members of His Body through baptism. God is now our Father, not in an allegorical sense, but in a very real sense. We are in Jesus and therefore God really <em>is </em>our Father.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>Our Acclamation</strong></span>– St. Paul says that the proof of our sonship is the movement of the Holy Spirit in us that cries out Abba! In Aramaic and Hebrew, Abba is the family term for father. It is not baby talk, like “Dada.” However, just as most adults call their father “Dad” or some other endearment rather than the more formal “Father,” so Abba is used in a similar way. It would be quite a daring thing for us to call God “Dad” unless we were permitted to do so and instructed to do so by Christ.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="color: #000000">St. Paul speaks of this word, Abba, as proof that we are sons. In so doing, he emphasizes that it is not merely the saying of the word that he refers to. Even a parrot can be taught to say the word. Rather, St. Paul is referring to what the word represents: an inner movement of the Holy Spirit wherein we experience a deep affection for God the Father. By our adoption, our baptism into Christ, by our reception of the Holy Spirit, we love the Father! We develop a deep affection for Him and dread offending Him. By this gift of the Spirit, God is our Father, whom we deeply love!</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #0000ff"><strong>Our Advancement</strong></span>– Notice that St. Paul then speaks of how we have moved from being slaves to being sons, heirs. In Jesus, we are not just <em>any </em>son; we are the only Son of the Father. As Jesus has a kingdom from His Father, so do we as we too inherit it with Him. As sons in the Son, we are heirs with Jesus to the Kingdom!  Jesus speaks of His disciples as reigning with Him one day: <em>And I confer on you a kingdom, just as my Father conferred one on me </em>(Lk 22:29). In Jesus, all Heaven will be ours and we will reign with Him forever. This is not our doing, not our glory; it is Christ’s doing and His glory in which we share.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Thus we have a very rich tapestry on this New Year’s Day, </strong>this feast of the Octave of Christmas, this Feast of the Circumcision of the Lord, this Feast of the Most Holy Name of Jesus, this Feast of Mary, Mother of God. We are given this feast wherein the glory of Christ is held before us and we who are members of His Body are told of the gifts that we receive by His holy incarnation and His passion, death, and resurrection.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">It’s not a bad way to start the new year: being reminded of God’s incredible love for us and of His rich blessings and promises.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Today, we observe the feast of the Holy Innocents,</strong> a feast commemorating the young children, of even younger age who were cruelly murdered by the paranoid and crazed killer known as Herod &#8220;the Great.&#8221; So paranoid was he that others might usurp or limit his power that he killed three of his own sons, and his wife. He ruthlessly killed many others as well. As his own death drew near, according to Josephus,  Herod decreed that in order that the nation properly mourn his death, one member of each family should be killed in his honor, and thus the mourning in all Israel for him would be sincere. His last and final act as King was to rise from his death bed and sentence to death a group of Jewish zealots who had removed an Eagle he place over the entrance of the temple. They had thought the image a desecration. Having killed them, he himself died (in bed) the next day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Herod was a cruel tyrant and a ruthless and paranoid killer.</strong> Calling him &#8220;the Great&#8221; can only be a reference to his skill in architecture and building and to his headship of the equally cruel Herodian dynasty.</p>
<p id="31003023" style="text-align: justify"><strong>Yet here Christ was born and found, in the midst of crisis and disaster.</strong> More than ever, the Christmas message is relevant. For despite our cruelty and despite the crises of this world, Christ is still to be found. He was born in one of the most crisis-torn regions of the world. He bids us to find him in just these sorts of places and times, as if to say, there is still hope: <em>The mercies of the Lord are not exhausted, his compassion is not spent; it is renewed each morning</em> (Lam 3:22-23).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">That he was willing to be born in such circumstances is clear, and from this we see his mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>But  from our perspective he should not have to have been born like this. And thus our call to repentance remains.</strong> This crisis at Christmas was our human doing, our insensitivity. As Scripture says, <em>He came unto his own, and his own received him not</em> (Jn 1:11). That&#8217;s us the scriptures are talking about, No room in the inn.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>And while Herod may be said to have acted alone, we cannot evade all responsibility</strong>, for to some extent we all participate in making and maintaining a cruel world where such ignominies routinely happen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Children have much to suffer in this world of our collective making.</strong> And while not all of us are equally guilty of contributing to the suffering of children, none of us are wholly innocent either, if for no other reason than our silence.</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Our culture has sinned against children by</strong> <strong>sexualizing them,</strong> robbing them of their innocence at an earlier and earlier age, and exposing them to all sorts of indoctrination and experimentation in schools. The most recent horrors center on exposing even kindergarteners to confusing sexual messages<span style="font-size: 1rem"> and practices related to transgenderism, homosexuality, &#8220;drag-queen story hours&#8221; and many other practices that desensitize and groom little children in sexual matters about which they need not know so far before puberty. We used to have a discretion about this; we used to protect little children from sexual matters, rightly concluding that they were too young to understand and that such matters could trouble and confuse them. Adults speaking to little children about these matters used to be considered a grave and even criminal violation.  What is wrong with so many today? And how is it legal for doctors to administer puberty blocking drugs and even perform mastectomies and genital mutilations on minors (with or without parental permission)?  Imagine the health complications in stopping puberty, a natural and essential stage of growth! How can a minor make such life-altering and often permanent decisions?  It is a sin against these children to incite sexual confusion, indulge it and even cooperate in dangerous hormonal and surgical interventions in service of a lie that one can alter their sex. All this used to be obvious to us until about five minutes ago in our culture. </span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify"><strong>Next, consider that most children born today are no longer born into the lasting family units they deserve </strong>with a father and mother committed to one another till death do them part. The problems begin with fornication, which is rampant in our culture. And while most do not think of this as a sin of injustice, it is. It is so because of what it does primarily to children.</li>

<li style="text-align: justify"><strong>Many children are also conceived of fornication</strong>. <strong>Tragically most of these children who are thus conceived are outright killed by abortion.</strong> 85% of abortions are performed on unmarried women. And for all the vaunted declarations of how contraception makes every baby a wanted baby, nothing could be further from the truth. Abortion has skyrocketed with the availability of contraception. This is because the problem is not fertility, it is lust, promiscuity, fornication and adultery. And contraception fuels these problems by further enabling them. The promises associated with contraception are lies, it does the opposite of what it promises.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify"><strong>So, fornication and the contraceptive mentality (founded on lies) cause grave harm to children</strong>, beginning with death, in huge numbers. And the children, conceived of fornication who do (thankfully) survive are, nevertheless subjected to the injustice of usually being born into irregular situations. There are single mothers, some single fathers, and many other irregularities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify"><strong>Add to this picture the large number of divorced families</strong>. And make no mistake, these shredded families cause great hardships and pain for children that include: children being shuttled back and forth between different household each week, having to meet &#8220;daddy&#8217;s new girlfriend&#8221; or mommy&#8217;s new &#8220;live-in boy-friend&#8221; and all sorts of other family chaos. Blended families also dramatically increase the likelihood of sexual and emotional abuse, since legal relationships seldom have the built-in protections of natural relationships. To be sure, not all people are divorced in the same way. Some tried to prevent it but their spouse was unwilling, etc. Still the harm caused to children remains.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All of this misbehavior, individual and cultural, harms children.</strong> Not being raised in a traditional marriage dramatically increases a child’s likelihood of suffering many other social ills, starting with poverty.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;text-align: justify"><em>The chief cause of poverty in this country, is the single motherhood, absent fatherhood.<br />
71% of poor families are not married.<br />
Children of single parent homes are 2 times more likely to be arrested for juvenile crime,<br />
2 times more likely be treated for emotional and behavioral problems,<br />
Twice as likely to be suspended or expelled from school,<br />
33% more likely to drop out of school,<br />
3 times more likely to end up in jail by age 30.<br />
50% more likely to live in poverty as adults,<br />
And twice as likely to have a child outside of marriage themselves</em>. [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Marriage-Conversation-Right-Effective/dp/1937155803/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352422735&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=getting+the+marriage+conversation+right">*</a>]</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Not all of us do all these things personally and to the same degree</strong>. We should further note that abortion is complex and some women have recourse to it out of despair, others are pressured and so forth. But the point emphasized in this reflection is that all of us do contribute to the sort of culture that is increasingly poisonous and unjust to children if not downright deadly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>If nothing else, too many of (starting with clergy) are far too silent</strong> about the sins of injustice committed against children. Many remain quite silent while the bad behaviors adults pile up in our culture. Our silence is largely the product of fearing to offend other adults. Meanwhile children suffer, and the injustices pile higher, beginning with the body count of aborted babies and watered by the tears of surviving children who have had much to suffer.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Something to think about on the feast of the Holy Innocents</strong>.</p>
<p>I put the following video together to honor these young martyrs. The musical setting is by Michael Haydn of the hymn for the Feast of the Holy Innocents: <em>Salvete Flores Martyrum</em> The Latin text of this ancient hymn is quite beautiful. I produce here the Latin text followed by a fairly literal translation.</p>
<p>Salvete flores martyrum, – Hail Martyr Flowers<br />
quos lucis ipso in limine – On the very threshold of the dawn (of life)<br />
Christi insecutor sustulit – Christ’s persecutor destroyed (you)<br />
ceu turbo nascentes rosas. – like the whirlwind does the budding roses.</p>
<p>Vos prima Christi victima, – You Christ’s firstfruits<br />
grex immolatorum tener, – A flock of tender sacrificial victims<br />
aram sub ipsam simplices – right up by the very altar<br />
palma et coronis luditis. – now play with your palms and crowns</p>
<p>Iesu, tibi sit gloria, – Jesus to you be glory<br />
qui natus es de Virgine, – who were born of the Virgin<br />
cum Patre et almo Spiritu, – with the Father and loving Spirit<br />
in sempiterna saecula. Amen. – unto to eternal ages. Amen.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p class="p1">It is a nearly universal practice among Catholics to have a nativity set in our homes and surely in our parishes. Not only does the nativity set remind us of the birth of Christ, it is also a miniature replica of the Church. In the scene we see God (Jesus) and man, saints (Jesus Mary and Joseph) and sinners (all the rest), the rich (the Magi) and the poor, (Mary Joseph, Jesus and the shepherds). We see the learned (the Magi) and the 
64f5
simple (the shepherds). There are Jews and Gentiles since the Magi are Gentiles and the rest are Jews. In this midst of this diverse scene, Jesus is found!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>While it may seem &#8220;institutional&#8221; to ponder the Church on Christmas Day, please realize that it is not. The Church is not an institution, the Church is the Body of Christ; He the Head of the Body, the Church and we, his members (cf Col 1:18; 1 Cor 12:27). Therefore we do well to ponder Christ&#8217;s presence in the Nativity setting and what it teaches us about his Body, the Church. Let&#8217;s ponder some of the elements:</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>Divine and Human</strong></span> &#8211;  Cleary, Christ alone is divine and all the other figures are human or animals. But it is essential, when pondering the Church to remember that the Church is both divine and human. The Church is divine because it is Christ&#8217;s body and he is the head of the Body as noted above. It is human because we are members of Christ&#8217;s Body, the Church. Let&#8217;s be clear, if it wasn&#8217;t for the divine indwelling of the Church by Christ&#8217;s headship and the presence of his Holy Spirit, the Church would have lasted only twenty minutes, max. But the Church is still here, 2,000 years later proclaiming the same Gospel. The Church is a miracle. There is simply no way to explain it perdurance except that Christ is its head. We can call the Church &#8220;Holy&#8221; because of Christ, but without him we know sin from the human dimension of the Church would have destroy it centuries ago. Jesus, the Second Person of the Blessed Trinity is found at the center of the nativity scene, surrounded by the human beings he loves. The Church is human, to be sure, but the Church is also divine and thus holy and an object of faith.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>Saints and Sinners</strong></span> &#8211; Jesus of course is sinless and holy. By his grace so is Mary his mother. Joseph is surely a saint even if not sinless from conception. The rest are sinners. Today also in the Church are saints and sinners. Some of the saints are perfected and in heaven. Some of the saintly are still among us here on earth, even if not perfected yet. And, to be sure, most of us are still sinners trying to make it in. This is the Church: many who are holy, and many who are sinners striving for holiness. Sadly there are also among us some who aren&#8217;t even trying to be holy, but the Church still holds us close and Christ is still calling. There is an impatience by many that the Church is not very holy and has too many scandals. Indeed, one is too many, but a perfect Church would be an empty Church, at least here on earth. Hospitals work for healing, but must admit the sick. So too the Church which is called to heal, must admit sinners to do so. Christ is found in Bethlehem among both saints and sinners. So too today.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000">Learned and Simple</span> </strong>&#8211; In the Nativity Scene we Have Jesus surrounded by the learned and the simple. The wise men were learned, the shepherds were likely simple, unlettered men. Joseph and Mary knew their Scripture and the Jewish Law but were not likely credentialed scholars. In the Church too we have those of great learning, we have unlettered peasants and everyone in between. Saints Augustine and Aquinas, Saints Theresa of Avila and Catherine of Siena are all learned Doctors (teachers) of the faith in a Church which has a great deposit of faith and learning. And yet, many unlettered and simple believers also fill our pews throughout the world and through time.  The Church is the patron of the arts and sciences and also the refuge of the poor and simple.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>Rich And Poor</strong></span> &#8211; The Magi were surely wealthy for they came with gold, frankincense and myrrh. The rest were likely among the working poor. They were not destitute, but their wages permitted little frills. So to the Church through time has included the rich and the poor and always together. A certain Anglican, years ago converted to the Catholic Faith in England. Upon hearing of his plans, his mother fretted: &#8220;Oh dear, you will be worshipping with &#8216;the help.'&#8221; Indeed, in a Catholic parish one may just as easily find the banker and the laborer kneeling in the same pew. The Church has benefited from certain wealthy benefactors, but has always been a home to the poor.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000">Jew and Gentile</span></strong> &#8211; In the nativity scene, wth the arrival of the Magi, we see Jews and Gentiles together with Christ. In the Creed we describe the Church as one, holy, catholic and apostolic. The term “catholic” means universal. People of every nation, race and language are summoned to Christ and the Church has a mission “unto the ends of the earth.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jesus said to the apostles, <i>Going therefore, teach all nations; baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you</i> (Matt 28:19-20). Today we can rightly claim that the Catholic Church is in every land, speaks every language and summons everyone to accept Jesus Christ and live his teachings. If you look at most Catholic parishes in our region you will see what looks like the United Nations. There is an old expression regarding the Church: “Here comes everyone!”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>Added to our Nativity scene are also the Angels</strong></span> who gathered that night. And, though invisible to our eyes, they dwell among us in unimaginable numbers. Wherever you go, the angels are everywhere attending to creation and assisting in our human endeavors. Trust God’s assistance and providence! We are not alone, myriads of angels assist and surround us and assist the Church!</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>Finally, and most humbly, do not neglect to notice what the older translations called the “ox and the ass.”</strong> </span>St. Francis of Assisi who gave us the Nativity Set as a devotion placed them there in fulfillment of the Prophet Isaiah who wrote: <i>The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master&#8217;s manger: but Israel has not known me, and my people has not understood</i> (Is 1:3). I suppose the implied question is “Are you as smart as an ox or an ass?” We ought to be smarter, but too often we compare poorly to these otherwise stubborn and stupid animals if we fail to seek the Lord where he is humbly found.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">This Christmas and every Christmas, we can learn a lot just by studying the Nativity sets we set up. I like you, strive to go to that humble and challenging place where the Lord is actually found. We may wish to find him in a church or family of our own design. Instead, he is found in a complex place that includes the rich and poor, the learned and simple, Jew and Gentile, saints and sinners, even the likes of you and me.</p>
<p class="p1">And he is not ashamed to call us his brethren (see Heb 2:11).<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>

In short, we’ve got it bad and that ain’t good. But praise the Lord, there is a doctor on the way. His name is Emmanuel; His name is Jesus, which means “God saves.”</p>
<p>Let’s look at a keynote reading of Advent describing five reasons we Jesus a savior!</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong> I. Distant Sons</strong> </span>&#8211; <strong><em>Hear, O heavens, and listen, O earth, for the Lord speaks: Sons have I raised and reared, but they have disowned me! An ox knows its owner, and an ass, its master’s manger; But Israel does not know, my people has not understood. Ah! sinful nation, people laden with wickedness, evil race, corrupt children! They have forsaken the Lord, spurned the Holy One of Israel, apostatized</em></strong> (Is 1:2-4).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>At the heart of most of our troubles is that we have distanced ourselves from God</strong>. Sometimes this is through forgetfulness rooted in a dullness of mind. Culturally in the West we have moved God to the periphery by an increasingly strident secularism. We are distant children. Collectively speaking, we have disowned our Father: the God who made us and who enables us to do everything we have done.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>In so doing, we are cutting ourselves off from the very source of our power and achievement. This, of course, is the height of foolishness.</strong> Consider a fan that has just been unplugged. At first the blades continue to spin and the fan may “think” that all is well. But gradually the blades move more and more slowly. Eventually, they stop completely. It is this way with us as well.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>Most of us believers are rightly concerned that our culture, having been unmoored, is becoming just as God described faithless ancient Israel: a sinful nation laden with wickedness, evil, and corruption</strong>. No age of this “paradise lost” has ever been sinless, but increasingly we cannot even get consensus on the most basic moral issues: that killing infants in the womb is wrong, that homosexual acts are disordered, and that promiscuity is unhealthy for the body and the culture. Even the most rudimentary understanding of biology shows that a life in the womb is a human baby and that homosexual acts are not meant to be (the parts don’t fit and the full purpose of sex is impossible). And clearly promiscuity brings disease. And this is just the biological evidence. Even a high school biology student can figure out that these practices are misguided.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>But so deep is our confusion, that even the most obvious aspects of things evade us</strong> as we get lost in our rationalizations and foolish attempts to justify what we know, deep down, is wrong. Yes, unplugged from God, we get a little slow in our thinking.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>The Lord goes on to compare His distant children to oxen and donkeys.</strong> Yes, even they are smarter than some of us, for they know their owner and who feeds them. Are you and I smarter than a donkey or an ox? There is a reason our nativity sets usually feature a donkey and a cow. <em>They</em> were there for the birth of Christ, but <em>we</em> had no room for him in the inn.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>So the first reason we need a savior is that we tend to stray from God.</strong> And having strayed, we get lost in more ways than one. God has to come find us, just as in the garden when the first couple sinned He went through the Garden calling, “Adam, where are you?” (Gen 3:9) So now He seeks us, His distant children.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong> II. Disease-Struck</strong></span> &#8211; <strong><em>Why will you still be struck down?</em></strong><strong><em> Why will you continue to rebel? The whole head is sick, the whole heart faint. From the sole of the foot to the head there is no sound spot: Wound and welt and gaping gash, not drained, or bandaged, or eased with salve</em> </strong>(Isaiah 1:5-6).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>This is a bad situation. </strong>The Lord says simply, “There is no sound spot.” The damage caused by sin is enormous and the Lord describes it sickening terms: wounds; welts; and horrifying, pus-filled, gaping gashes.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>We tend to make light of sin, but God does not.</strong> St. Paul put things more bluntly and tersely: “You were dead in your sins” (Eph 2:1).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>But making light of our sins we stand there and continue to get struck; we continue to rebel. We ignore the body count</strong> of abortion, the toll that divorce and promiscuity take on children, the high price of greed, and the foolishness of casting aside God and His wisdom.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>As God describes it, our stance is unreasonable and just plain stupid.</strong> We rebel, glory in evil things, and assert a false notion of freedom. But God says to us that if we could only see ourselves as He does, we would be sickened: gaping wounds and foul discharge.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>Jesus said to Sister Faustina</strong>, <em>You see what you are of yourself, but do not be frightened at this. If I were to reveal to you the whole misery that you are, you would die of terror. … But because you are such great misery I have revealed to you the whole ocean of my mercy</em> (Diary II. 718).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>Here, then, is the second reason we need a savior</strong>: Our sins and stubbornness have made us wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked (Rev 3:17). We cannot save ourselves. Only with grace and mercy do we stand a chance. We need more than an angel; we need a savior.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>III. Desolate Scene </strong></span><strong>&#8211; <em>Your country is waste, your cities burnt with fire. Your land before your eyes strangers devour, [a waste, like Sodom overthrown]—And daughter Zion is left like a hut in a vineyard, Like a shed in a melon patch, like a city blockaded. Unless the Lord of hosts had left us a scanty remnant, We had become as Sodom, we should be like Gomorrah</em></strong> (Is 1:7-9).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>Ruined cultures eventually produced ruined cities and plundered landscapes.</strong> You don’t think it can happen today? Throughout the age of the Church, empires have risen and fallen, countries have come and gone, and powerful coalitions have gathered and fallen apart. None of them thought that <em>they</em> would collapse either. But they are all gone. Where is Rome? Where is the Napoleonic Empire? Where is the USSR? It was once said, “The sun never sets on the British Empire.” Now it does. The Church alone, by Christ’s promise, is indefectible. And she, too, needs often-severe purifications.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>In the Bible the usual focus was on land, crops, and buildings. In our age, we speak of “economies.”</strong> But no matter what we call it, we cannot have strong economies or unless we are strong, true, consistent and disciplined. Our moral decline produces a decadence (from the Latin for “to be fallen down”) and a laziness.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>We are even too lazy to have children.</strong> And thus the text above speaks of “strangers devouring your land.” Once-Christian Europe is soon to become a Muslim caliphate. Hagia Sophia became a mosque; will the great cathedrals of Europe go the same way?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>In America the situation is more complex.</strong> Thankfully, most of our immigrants are Catholic Christians. But it does seem clear that our years of being an economic and political leader among the nations is fading; the thinning soil of our culture can little longer sustain the taller growths. Our economy has been stagnant for at least a decade now, and unemployment is shockingly high. There’s no telling where it will end up, but things don’t look very vigorous right now.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>And here is the third reason we need a savior:</strong> to save us from the mess we’ve made and reinvigorate us with the things that make for healthy families, healthy communities, a healthy culture, and a healthy Church. We need rebuilding, reinvigoration, restoration, refocusing, and reformation.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>IV. Disconnected Sacrifices </strong></span>&#8211; <strong><em>Hear the word of the Lord, princes of Sodom! Listen to the instruction of our God, people of Gomorrah! What care I for the number of your sacrifices? says the Lord. I have had enough of whole-burnt rams and fat of fatlings; In the blood of calves, lambs and goats I find no pleasure. When you come in to visit me, who asks these things of you? Trample my courts no more! Bring no more worthless offerings; your incense is loathsome to me. New moon and sabbath, calling of assemblies, octaves with wickedness: these I cannot bear. Your new moons and festivals I detest; they weigh me down, I tire of the load. When you spread out your hands, I close my eyes to you; Though you pray the more, I will not listen. Your hands are full of blood! Wash yourselves clean! Put away your misdeeds from before my eyes; cease doing evil; learn to do good. Make justice your aim: redress the wronged, hear the orphan’s plea, defend the widow</em></strong> (Is 1:10-19).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>Even our worship lacks integrity.</strong> That which is supposed to glorify God and bring forth in us a holy obedience has become lip service. God seeks hearts that are humble, docile, loving, and repentant. We cannot buy Him off by just singing hymns, saying a few prayers, or attending Mass. These things, good though they are, are meant to effect a conversion in us that makes us more loving of both God and neighbor, less violent, more just, more merciful, more generous to the poor, and more holy. Our worship should effect change in us such that we cease doing evil and learn to do good, we strive for justice, we address injustice, and we defend and help the poor.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>An additional problem with our worship today is that God has become almost an afterthought. Much of our liturgy is self-centered</strong>, self-congratulatory, and anthropocentric (rather than theocentric). We are “the aware, gathered community celebrating itself.” While the Mass should focus on God and summon us to humility and joy before Him, too often it seems more an exercise in pride and self-congratulation. We are very narcissistic, even in a communal setting.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>God cannot be pleased with all of this. Even if our worship is rightly ordered, we are not going to buy God off</strong>. God wants an obedient heart more than sacrifice. Sacrifice without obedience is a sham.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>This is the fourth reason we need a savior: We need God to restore our integrity and give us a new heart</strong>. We are “dis-integrated,” in the sense that pieces of our life that should be together (e.g., worship and obedience, liturgy and healing) are not. Too often our worship does just the opposite of what it should. Instead of drawing us more deeply into the love and obedience of God it becomes the very occasion of keeping God at a distance and seeking to placate him with superficial gestures. This makes our worship an insult and a lie. God doesn’t mince words in the passage above when He says how displeased He is with this.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><strong>We need God to give us a new heart,</strong> one that loves Him as well as the people and things that He loves. Only then will our worship will truly reflect the heart that God seeks: a loving, humble, and generous heart.</p>

		<p><span style="color: #000000">As the end of Advent approaches, the Office of Readings features some final admonitions from the Book of the Prophet Isaiah. On the one hand they console; on the other, they challenge us to remain firm.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">Let’s look at these admonitions from the Lord (<a href="http://www.usccb.org/bible/isaiah/46:3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Isaiah 46:3-13</a>), which were addressed to three different groups in ancient Israel. However, let’s apply them to three groups in our own times: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #000000">the faithful remnant, </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">the foolish rebels, and </span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000">the fainthearted at risk.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>To the Faithful Remnant</strong></span> &#8211; <strong><em>Hear me, O house of Jacob, all who remain of the house of Israel, my burden since your birth, whom I have carried from your infancy. Even to your old age I am the same, even when your hair is gray I will bear you; It is I who have done this, I who will continue, and I who will carry you to safety.</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>This is directed to the devoted, to the remnant, to those who remain after the cultural revolution in our times, to those 
269a
sometimes discouraged and sorrowful</strong> over the infidelity of loved ones and of the world around them. To these (often the elderly among us who remember a more faithful even if imperfect time) the Lord first speaks.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>In effect, He says, <em>Blessed are those who mourn,</em></strong><em> for they shall be comforted.</em> Who are the mournful? They are those who see the awful state of God’s people: not glorifying the Lord in their lives, not knowing why they were made, spending themselves on what neither matters nor satisfies. Yes, those who mourn shall be strengthened, and, as their sorrow has motivated them to pray and work for the kingdom, they shall be borne to safety.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>This faithful remnant should never forget</strong> that God has carried them from the beginning, even in the strength of their prime. Now, reduced by age, they are still carried by the Lord. He has never forgotten them and will carry them to safety; their faith in difficult times will be rewarded.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>To The Foolish Rebels </strong></span>&#8211; <strong><em>Remember this and bear it well in mind, you rebels; remember the former things, those long ago: I am God, there is no other; I am God, there is none like me. Whom would you compare me with, as an equal, or match me against, as though we were alike? There are those who pour out gold from a purse and weigh out silver on the scales; Then they hire a goldsmith to make it into a god before which they fall down in worship. They lift it to their shoulders to carry; when they set it in place again, it stays, and does not move from the spot. Although they cry out to it, it cannot answer; it delivers no one from distress.</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>The word “rebel” is from the Latin</strong> <em>re</em> (again) + <em>bellum</em> (war). In this context it refers to those who are forever at war with God and His plan for their lives. They foolishly forget His saving deeds. They imagine vain things: that there are other gods or entities that could save them. Even more foolishly, they craft other “gods” that they have to lift upon their shoulders to carry.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Many in our day act in the same way: always at war with God, </strong>His Church, and His plan. As G.K. Chesterton once noted, when people stop believing in God, it is not that they will believe in nothing but that they will believe in anything. Chesterton also wrote that when we break God’s big laws, we don’t get liberty; we get small laws. We transfer our trust away from God to false, crafted gods like government, or science, or the market. We hope that they will carry us, but we end up carrying the weight of these gods on our own shoulders. We carry this weight in the form of taxes, debt, and anxiety about everything in our health or environment (demanded by the increasingly politicized scientific and medical communities).</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Science, the market, and government are not intrinsically evil, but they are not gods, either.</strong> They cannot deliver us from ourselves; only God can do that. To the many who rebelliously and foolishly persist with their “non-gods,” He says, “I am God; there is no other.”</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>To the Fainthearted at Risk </strong></span>&#8211; <strong><em>Listen to me, you fainthearted, you who seem far from the victory of justice: I am bringing on my justice, it is not far off, my salvation shall not tarry; I will put salvation within Zion, and give to Israel my glory. At the beginning I foretell the outcome; in advance, things not yet done. I say that my plan shall stand, I accomplish my every purpose. I call from the east a bird of prey, from a distant land, one to carry out my plan. Yes, I have spoken, I will accomplish it; I have planned it, and I will do it.</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Among the faithful there are some who are at risk,</strong> who are nearly ready to give up. God encourages them, but also warns that His plan will stand whether or not they endure. Thus there is an implicit warning from Jesus here (and an explicit warning elsewhere) that we must persevere. Jesus says that because lawlessness is increased, most people’s love will grow cold. <em>But the one who endures to the end, he will be saved</em> (Matt 24:12-13).</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>St. Augustine wrote,</strong> <em>[God has] devised a plan, a great and wonderful plan … All this had therefore to be prophesied, foretold, and impressed on us as an event in the future, in order that we might wait for it in faith, and not find it as a sudden and dreadful reality</em> (From a discourse on the psalms by Saint Augustine, bishop (In ps. 109, 1-3: CCL 40, 1601-1603)).</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>God’s plan will stand whether or not we do.</strong> We must stand as well, even when we want to faint or fall back. Our love must not grow cold nor our strength fail. God has triumphed and Satan has lost. We must choose with whom we will stand.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>The evidence of the present age does not seem to show this, but as Scripture reminds us,</strong></span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="color: #000000"><em>Therefore, we do not lose heart … So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal</em> (2 Cor 4:16-17).</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px"><span style="color: #000000"><em>For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the boastful pride of life, is not from the Father, but is from the world. The world is passing away, and also its lusts; but the one who does the will of God lives forever</em> (1 Jn 2:16-17).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Here, then, are some final instructions from the Lord this Advent, instructions for us who wait for Him:</strong> be faithful; the plan will come to pass. Do not be a foolish rebel, nor one of the at-risk fainthearted. Rather, be part of the faithful remnant. St. Paul says, <em>Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: “Though the number of the Israelites be like the sand by the sea, only the remnant will be saved”</em> (Romans 9:27).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000">The song performed in the clip below is entitled “Lord Help Me to Hold Out.”</span></p>

It speaks to us of a crisis at Christmas.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>We tend to sentimentalize the Christmas story</strong> as we think of the baby Jesus in the manger. It is not absolutely wrong to be sentimental, but we must also be prayerfully sober about how difficult that first Christmas was, and about the heroic vir
214a
tue required of Mary and Joseph in order to cooperate with God in making it come to pass.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Let’s look at this Gospel in three stages:</strong> distress, direction, and decision.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong> DISTRESS </strong>–</span> <strong><em>This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about. When his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found with child through the Holy Spirit. Joseph her husband, since he was a righteous man, yet unwilling to expose her to shame, decided to divorce her quietly.</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify"><strong>The marriage is off. </strong>When we read that Mary was found to be with child before she and Joseph were together, we need to understand how devastating and dangerous this situation was. Pregnancy in this circumstance  brought forth a real crisis for both families involved in Joseph and Mary’s marriage plans. Quite simply, it put all plans for the continuation of the marriage permanently off.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify"><strong>Why is this?</strong> We read that Joseph was a “righteous man.” To our ears this like saying that he was a “good man.” Most of the Fathers of the Church interpreted “righteous” here to refer to Joseph’s gracious character and virtue where he steps back from a sacred situation. And we surely suppose all this of him. More recent biblical scholarship includes the idea that it meant Joseph was also an “observer of the Law.” He would thus do what the Law prescribed. This explains his decision to divorce Mary because of her apparent lack of virginity prior to their coming together in the  marriage. Here is an example of the Mosaic Law in reference to such a matter:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 70px;text-align: justify"><em>But if the tokens of virginity were not found in the young woman, then they shall bring out the young woman to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death with stones, because she has wrought folly in Israel by playing the harlot in her father’s house; so you shall purge the evil from the midst of you</em> (Deut 22:20-21).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">While this seems quite extreme to us, we can also recognize how far we have gone in the other direction in modern times, making light of promiscuity. I doubt that anyone would argue that we should stone such a woman today, and rightly so, but this was the landscape in Joseph’s time.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify"><strong>What about stoning? </strong>It would seem that Jews of the first century had varying interpretations about whether stoning was required or whether it was simply permitted (<em>cf</em> John 8). As a virtuous and patient man, Joseph looks for and senses some freedom in not “exposing” Mary to the full effects of the Law (stoning). But it does not seem he can find a way that he can take her into his home. Thus, as a “righteous man” (i.e., follower of the Law) he decides that divorce is required even if stoning is not.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify"><strong>This leads us to two important reflections, one about Mary and one about Joseph.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify"><strong>Mary</strong> &#8211; We can see into what a difficult and dangerous position her yes (her fiat) to the angel placed her. She risked her very life by being found with child outside the normal marital act with her husband. <em>We</em> know that it is by the Holy Spirit she conceives, but her family and Joseph and his family do not yet, or at least cannot verify it. And even if Mary explained exactly how she conceived, do you think <em>you</em> would accept such a story? Mary’s fiat placed her in real danger. It is a great testimony to her faith and trust in God that she said yes to His plans.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify"><strong>Joseph</strong> &#8211; We can also see the kind of pressure he would be under to do what the Law and custom required. There is no mention of Joseph’s feelings at this point, but we can assume that when Mary was found to be with child prior to their being together in marriage, the social pressure on him to be legally freed from Mary were strong, regardless of his feeling or plans.</p>
<ol style="text-align: justify" start="2">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong> DIRECTION</strong> –</span> <strong><em>Such was his intention [to divorce] when, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary your wife into your home. For it is through the Holy Spirit that this child has been conceived in her. She will bear a son and you are to name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Be not afraid. </strong>The principal exhortation of the angel was that Joseph “not be afraid” to take Mary as his wife. This exhortation is powerful because fear <em>was</em> a very big factor. Joseph had much to fear in taking Mary. Some of the Fathers of the Church believed that what the angel meant was that Joseph should not fear God’s wrath, since he would not actually be taking an adulterer or fornicator into his home. Others think that the angel meant that Joseph should not fear taking God’s chosen instrument (Mary) as his wife.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>One can also imagine some other fears</strong> that needed to be allayed by the angel. For example, Joseph could easily be rejected by his family for taking Mary in. The community could likewise shun him, and as a businessman, Joseph needed a good reputation to be able to ply his trade. All of these threats loom if Joseph “brings evil” into his house rather than purging the (apparent) evil from the midst of his house. But the angel directs him not to fear; this will take courageous faith.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>The angel’s explanation</strong> is unusual to say the least. What does it mean to conceive by the Holy Spirit? It’s not exactly a common occurrence! Would his family buy such an explanation? What about the others in the small town of Nazareth? Yes, people were more spiritual in those days, but it all seems so unusual!</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify"><span style="color: #000000"><strong>Further, Joseph hears all this in a dream. </strong>We all know what dreams can be like. They can seem so real at the time, but when we are fully awake we wonder if what we experienced was real at all. Joseph has to trust that what he was told is real, and that he should not be afraid because God has given him direction. As is often the case with things spiritual, we have to carefully discern and walk by faith, not by fleshly sight and certitude. Joseph has a decision to make.</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify" start="3">
<li><span style="color: #ff0000"><strong> DECISION</strong> –</span> <strong><em>When Joseph awoke, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took his wife into his home.</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">We can see the strong faith of Joseph and the kind of trust he had to put in God. He had been told not to be afraid, to rebuke fear. Manfully, Joseph does this. He makes the decision to obey God whatever the cost. We are given no information about how his family and others in the town reacted. However, the fact that the Holy family later settles back in Nazareth indicates that God did come through on His promise that Joseph need not be afraid.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify"><strong>Heroes of Faith! </strong>Recognize the crisis of that first Christmas and the powerful faith of Joseph and Mary. Their reputations were on the line, if not their very lives. They had great sacrifices to make in the wondrous incarnation of our Lord. Quite simply, Mary and Joseph are great heroes of the faith. For neither of them was their “yes” easy. It is often hard to obey God rather than men. Praise God that they made their decision 
2a3a
and obeyed.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify"><strong>Mary and Joseph’s difficulties were not yet over.</strong> There was a badly timed census, which required a journey to Bethlehem in the ninth month of Mary’s pregnancy. Imagine walking 70 miles through mountainous terrain in such a condition! There may or may not have been a donkey, but I doubt that riding a donkey in the ninth month of pregnancy is all that comfortable either. And then there was no room in the inn; Jesus had to be born in a smelly stable. Shortly thereafter they had to flee through the desert to Egypt because Herod sought to kill Jesus.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify"><strong>Jesus is found in a real Christmas, not a “Hallmark” one. </strong>The crisis of the first Christmas prefigures the passion. This where Jesus is found: in the crisis of the first Christmas. You may wish for the perfect Christmas, but there <em>is</em> no perfect Christmas. Jesus will find you where you are, in real life, in the imperfect Christmas, where loved ones have passed away and there is grief, where a job has been lost and there is anxiety, where health is poor and there is stress, where families are experiencing strife. That’s where Jesus will be found, in your <em>real</em> Christmas. A Christmas of joy, yes, but also of imperfections, even crises. He is there waiting for you to find Him, in the real Christmas of your life.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify">This is an old African-American spiritual that reflects on the fact that true discipleship isn’t always easy. Joseph and Mary surely experience and exemplify what these words express.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify"><em>I tol’ Jesus it would be all right<br />
If He changed my name</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify"><em>Jesus tol’ me I would have to live humble<br />
If He changed mah name</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify"><em>Jesus tol’ me that the world would be ‘gainst me<br />
If He changed mah name</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;text-align: justify"><em>But I tol’ Jesus it would be all right<br />
If He changed mah name</em></p>
